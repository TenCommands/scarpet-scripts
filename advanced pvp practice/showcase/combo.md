Combo Practice
---
In combo practice you can select a type of combo such as the `ShAxCb`, `SwSwSw`, `SwCr`, or `AnAn` just to name a few. The naming of the combos is determined by the steps of the combo. Here is what a few parts of the name means:
- `Sw` - Sword
- `Sh` - Shield
- `Ax` - Axe
- `Bo` - Bow
- `Cb` - Crossbow
- `An` - Anchor
- `Cr` - Crystal
- `Tr` - Trident
- `Mi` - Minecart
- `La` - Lava
- `Wa` - Water
- `Wl` - Wall
- `Bl` - Block
- `Sl` - Slab
- `St` - Stair

And so on...

In Combo practice there will be a single NPC where it will time you on a sequence that you have decided. You can create a sequence with a GUI where you can add a component, and set the inventory.
