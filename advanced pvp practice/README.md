Advanced PVP Practice
---
Are you tired of having to find crappy servers that don't give you everything you need to practice the latest versions of PVP in a customizable environment, without limitations stopping you from practicing whatever and whenever you want? Are you tired of having to wait for players to queue for you to get to practice your skills, only for them to leave right after? Are you tired of not having full control over the training environment? **Look No Further** because I have made the ultimate training map. It takes place in singleplayer so you don't need to worry about crappy ping, or limited items. With this map and only 2 mods, you can have the ultimate PVP Training Experience. I introduce to you **Arena Mastery**
